# Multiverse Theory
Multi-agent system simulating teamwork of gods.

Done by: Brazhko Polina, Ko≈Çakowska Aleksandra, Litkowski Andrzej

To run: Simply run class `teamwork.Main` with 1 argment - path to json file with initial state (look at `test-settings.json`)

All needed libs are given in `/lib` folder, so they can be added from there (but in intellij they should be added correctly anyway).

Used libraries: 
* JADE - agent platform
* GSON - reading json with settings
